1 - To be, or not to be: that is the question:
2 - Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
3 - The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
4 - Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
5 - And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
6 - No more; and by a sleep to say we end
7 - The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
8 - That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
9 - Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
10 - To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
11 - For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
12 - When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
13 - Must give us pause: there's the respect
14 - That makes calamity of so long life;
15 - For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
16 - The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
17 - The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
18 - The insolence of office and the spurns
19 - That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
20 - When he himself might his quietus make
21 - With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
22 - To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
23 - But that the dread of something after death,
24 - The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
25 - No traveller returns, puzzles the will
26 - And makes us rather bear those ills we have
27 - Than fly to others that we know not of?
28 - Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
29 - And thus the native hue of resolution
30 - Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
31 - And enterprises of great pith and moment
32 - With this regard their currents turn awry,
33 - And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
34 - The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
35 - Be all my sins remember'd!
